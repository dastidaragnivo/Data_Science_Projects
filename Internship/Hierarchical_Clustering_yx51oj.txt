Hierarchical clustering :

hierarchy can be formed either in the "top down" approach or in the 
"bottom up" approach.

Agglomerative clustering:

-- This is the bottom up approach.
-- Every data point is treated as a single cluster initially.
-- Then, groups are created with the combination of the nearest points.
-- This process is repeated until finally one single cluster is formed
which encompasses all the data points.

Divisive clustering :

-- This is the top down appraoch.
-- All the data points are considered as one cluster initially.
-- Then, splitting begins--> yields in different groups or clusters (until 
each point is separated out as a single cluster)


Dendrogram :

-- It is a graphical way to display the hierarchical sequence of clusters.
-- In the dendrogram, each node represents a cluster
-- Each leaf node is an individual data point.
-- Root node / top node represents the whole dataset (final single cluster)
-- All the internal nodes will have only 2 children. 
-- Note that the groups are formed from those children nodes only.

Working of the agglomerative clustering:

-- Proximity matrix(distance matrix) will be computed first.
-- Will start checking for those points that are nearer to each other
-- The nearest 2 points are merged together 
-- The proximity matrix is updated

Again the above steps repeat until only one single cluster remains.
